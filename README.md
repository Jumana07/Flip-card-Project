A simple Flip-Card Project with Html and Css

## Flip Card Documentation

### HTML Structure

The flip card is created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structure consists of the following elements:

1. `div` with class "container": This container element is used to center the flip card both horizontally and vertically on the page.

2. `div` with class "flip-card": This div represents the flip card itself.

3. `div` with class "flip-card-inner": This div represents the inner part of the flip card that will be flipped.

4. `div` with class "flip-card-front": This div represents the front side of the flip card.

5. `div` with class "flip-card-back": This div represents the back side of the flip card.

6. `h2` element: This is a placeholder element that can be replaced with the desired content for the front and back sides of the flip card.

### CSS Styles

The CSS styles are responsible for the visual appearance and animation of the flip card. Here are the key CSS classes and properties used:

1. `.container`: This class is applied to the container `div` and is used to center the flip card both horizontally and vertically on the page using flexbox properties.

2. `.flip-card`: This class is applied to the main flip card `div` and sets the perspective for the 3D transformation.

3. `.flip-card-inner`: This class is applied to the inner `div` of the flip card and contains the front and back sides. It defines the transition and transformation properties for the flip animation.

4. `.flip-card-front`: This class is applied to the front side `div` of the flip card and represents the visible content of the card when it is not flipped.

5. `.flip-card-back`: This class is applied to the back side `div` of the flip card and represents the content that is revealed when the card is flipped.

### JavaScript Interaction

The JavaScript code is not included in the provided example as it is not required for the basic functionality of the flip card. However, you can add JavaScript code to trigger the flipping animation on certain user interactions, such as hovering over the card.

### Usage

To use the flip card code in your project, follow these steps:

1. Copy the HTML structure and CSS styles provided into your HTML file.

2. Modify the content within the `h2` elements of the front and back sides to reflect the desired content for your flip card.

3. Customize the CSS styles as needed to match your design preferences.

4. If desired, add JavaScript code to add interactivity to the flip card.

5. Save and test your HTML file in a web browser to see the flip card in action.

Please note that the provided code serves as a basic template for a flip card and can be further customized and expanded to suit your specific requirements.
